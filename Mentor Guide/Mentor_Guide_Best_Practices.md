- **Use Real Scenarios:** Present actual case studies from industry
- **Encourage Curiosity:** Ask "What if..." dan "How might..." questions
- **Suspend Judgment:** Create safe space for all observations
- **Focus on Users:** Constantly redirect attention to end users

**User Interview Facilitation:**
```
Facilitation Script for User Interviews:

"Today we're going to step into the shoes of network users. Remember:
- Listen more than you speak
- Ask 'why' to understand motivations
- Observe non-verbal cues
- Avoid leading questions
- Stay curious, not judgmental

Let's practice with this scenario: [Present specific user scenario]

Guiding Questions:
1. What does a typical day look like for this user?
2. What are their biggest frustrations with network security?
3. What would make their life easier?
4. What are they afraid of regarding security?
5. How do they currently handle security issues?"
```

**Common Challenges dan Solutions:**
- **Challenge:** Students focus on technical solutions too early
  **Solution:** Redirect with "Let's understand the user first before thinking about solutions"

- **Challenge:** Superficial user understanding
  **Solution:** Use "5 Whys" technique to dig deeper

- **Challenge:** Bias towards own experiences
  **Solution:** Encourage diverse perspectives dan role-playing
```

### 2. Define Phase Facilitation
```markdown

- [Criteria 2]

Remember our troubleshooting approach:
1. Understand the problem
2. Gather information
3. Form hypothesis
4. Test hypothesis
5. Document solution

Let's start with the topology overview..."
```

**2. Guided Implementation (60-90 minutes):**
- Demonstrate key concepts first
- Allow hands-on practice immediately
- Circulate to provide individual support
- Address common issues proactively
- Encourage peer helping

**3. Troubleshooting Support:**
```
Troubleshooting Facilitation Approach:

Instead of giving direct answers, use guided questions:

"What symptoms are you seeing?"
"What do you think might be causing this?"
"What have you tried so far?"
"What would you check next?"
"How can you verify your hypothesis?"

Only provide direct help when:
- Student is completely stuck after guided questioning
- Time constraints require faster resolution
- Safety atau security concerns exist
- Fundamental concept misunderstanding needs correction
```

**Common Technical Issues dan Solutions:**

| Issue | Symptoms | Guided Questions | Solution Hints |
|-------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| IP Conflicts | Connectivity failures | "What IP addresses are you using?" | Check IP addressing scheme |
| VLAN Misconfig | Inter-VLAN issues | "How are VLANs configured?" | Verify VLAN assignments |
| ACL Problems | Blocked traffic | "What does the ACL permit/deny?" | Check ACL order dan logic |
| Routing Issues | No connectivity | "What does the routing table show?" | Verify routing configuration |
| Switch Port Issues | Link down | "What's the port status?" | Check port configuration |
```

What would be the impact?
How can we prevent this?
Let's implement that protection..."

Example Scenarios:
- Unauthorized network access
- Data interception
- Denial of service
- Privilege escalation
- Data exfiltration
```

**2. Red Team/Blue Team Exercises:**
